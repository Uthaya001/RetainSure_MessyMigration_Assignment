# Refactoring Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the problems identified in the original legacy codebase and the improvements made during the refactoring process.

## Problems Identified in Original Code

### 1. Code Organization Issues (25%)
- **Single File Architecture**: All code was contained in one monolithic `app.py` file
- **Mixed Concerns**: Routes, business logic, database operations, and validation were all mixed together
- **Poor Function Names**: Functions had unclear or generic names
- **No Separation of Layers**: No clear distinction between presentation, business, and data layers
- **Hard to Maintain**: Changes in one area could break unrelated functionality

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities (25%)
- **Plain Text Passwords**: Passwords were stored in plain text in the database
- **No Input Validation**: User inputs were not validated or sanitized
- **SQL Injection Risk**: Raw SQL queries with string concatenation
- **No Error Handling**: Sensitive error information could be exposed to users
- **Missing Authentication**: Login endpoint existed but didn't verify credentials properly

### 3. Poor Development Practices (25%)
- **No Error Handling**: No try-catch blocks, causing crashes on errors
- **Inconsistent HTTP Status Codes**: All responses returned 200, regardless of success/failure
- **No Logging**: No way to debug issues or monitor application behavior
- **Hardcoded Values**: Database paths and configuration values were hardcoded
- **No Input Sanitization**: Risk of XSS and other injection attacks

### 4. Missing Documentation & Testing (25%)
- **No Documentation**: No README, comments, or API documentation
- **No Tests**: No unit tests or integration tests
- **No Environment Configuration**: No way to configure the application for different environments
- **No Setup Instructions**: No guidance on how to run or deploy the application

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Code Organization Improvements
✅ **Modular Architecture**: Separated code into logical modules:
- `routes/user_routes.py`: HTTP endpoint definitions
- `services/user_service.py`: Business logic layer
- `models/db.py`: Database operations
- `utils/validation.py`: Input validation utilities

✅ **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
✅ **Meaningful Names**: Functions and variables have descriptive names
✅ **Application Factory Pattern**: Clean app initialization in `app.py`

### 2. Security Enhancements
✅ **Password Hashing**: Implemented secure password hashing using `werkzeug.security`
```python
# Before: Plain text storage
password = user_data['password']

# After: Secure hashing
password_hash = generate_password_hash(user_data['password'])
